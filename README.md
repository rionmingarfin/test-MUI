## Introduction

I'm building a Pokémon app using Next.js and TypeScript. The app will display all Pokémon, including their types and detailed information. I'm leveraging Vercel for deployment with CI/CD and Docker for containerization. To manage language changes globally, I'm using the Context API. For styling, I'm combining Material UI and Tailwind CSS. Finally, I'll be using Axios to fetch data from the Pokémon API.
Open https://pokemon-chi-jade.vercel.app/ with your browser to see the result.
