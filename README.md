## Introduction

I'm building a Pokémon app using Next.js and TypeScript. It will display all Pokémon, their types, and detailed information. For state management, I'm using the context API to handle language changes as global state. I'll use Material UI and Tailwind CSS for styling, and Axios to fetch data from the API.
Open https://pokemon-chi-jade.vercel.app/ with your browser to see the result.
